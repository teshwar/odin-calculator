# Calculator Project

## 📖 Introduction

You made it! 🎉  
By now, you should have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of JavaScript. This project puts everything together by building an **on-screen calculator** using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.

The calculator will let users perform basic arithmetic operations and give you practice combining logic, styling, and interactivity in a single project.

## 🛠️ Plan

My approach to building this calculator:

1. **HTML** → Structure the buttons and display area.
2. **CSS** → Style the calculator layout to look clean and responsive.
3. **JavaScript** → Add the logic for handling user input and performing calculations.

## 🚀 Features (Planned)

- Clear and user-friendly UI.
- Buttons for digits `0–9`, operators (`+ - × ÷`), and equals.
- Functionality for clearing/resetting the display.
- Handles chained operations (e.g., `2 + 3 × 4`).
- Displays errors (like division by zero).

---

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox for layout)
- **JavaScript**

---

## 📅 Next Steps

- [✅] Build the base HTML layout (buttons + screen).
- [✅] Style with CSS for a neat calculator look.
- [ ] Add JavaScript logic to handle button clicks.
- [ ] Implement advanced features (e.g., decimals, keyboard support).

## 🎯 Goal

By finishing this project, I’ll have a **fully functional calculator** that demonstrates my knowledge of **DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling with CSS**.
